In a world where pets have become members of our families, their health and behavior is vitally important. We are excited to present the "Pet Pal" project, a comprehensive and user-friendly mobile application dedicated to revolutionizing the way we care for our beloved animals.
"Pet Pal" is a wide area service solution that enhances all aspects of pet health care and management and on the other hand their nutritional aspect as well. Our app offers a one-stop platform where pet owners can access vital information on medications, dietary guidance, and maintaining the ideal body weight for their pets. This is a one stop solution for major areas such as food, medication, experience and all the target users we aim for. 
This app is not about comfort; it's about enhancing the overall well-being of our canine companions. "Pet Pal" is a dedication to our living pets to foster and live a better and happier life. We are eager to achieve this goal through this commencement.
